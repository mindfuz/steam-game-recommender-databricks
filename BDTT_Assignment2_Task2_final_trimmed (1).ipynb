    "In this task, we will build a collaborative filtering recommender system using user data from Steam, a gaming platform. The dataset has four attributes: the user ID, game, user behaviour, and playtime (if the behaviour is play). This data allows us to infer user preferences in the absence of concrete, explicit ratings given by users towards games.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal is to develop a personalised recommender system which uses previous interaction history between user and games to determine which games a user might enjoy in future. The end result should show a list of N games linked to a specific user_id tailored to the user’s unique profile. As the Steam dataset is 200,000 rows, Spark is a good module to use as this can be considered Big Data.\n",

    "We will use Alternating Least Squares (ALS) algorithm for matrix factorisation, before analysing the performance of the algorithm using metrics such as RMSE and Precision@10. There will also be some examples of hyperparameter tuning, and all of the experiments will be tracked using MLflow. \n",

    "Verifying the validity of the data is crucial before moving on to developing the recommender system. Firstly, we discovered some basic information about the data, specifically around the user_ids and games. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains:\n",
    "- **Number of unique users**: 12393\n",
    "- **Number of unique games**: 5155\n",
    "- **Distribution of behaviour**: ~65% `purchase` entries and ~35% `play` entries  \n",
    "\n",
    "This final point was expected, as a game has to be purchased before it is played on.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then split the dataset into two separate dataframes: one where the behaviour was `play` and one for `purchase`. This would allow us to see how users interact with games, and how these interactions might become more apparent during preprocessing and modelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the ‘play’ dataframe, we checked for the top games by average playtime. The top two were Eastside Hockey Manager and Baldur’s Gate II, with many Football Manager titles taking up the spots from 3-12. A good recommender system might bundle these manager titles together for specific users.\n",
    "\n",
    "To validate data integrity of the dataset, we then searched for duplicate rows. As we touched upon earlier, if a row has the same user_id, game name, and behaviour, then it is a duplicate row and should be analysed further.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **719** duplicate rows across the entire df\n",
    "- **12** of these duplicate rows were where ‘behaviour’ = ‘play’\n",
    "- **707** duplicate purchase entries\n",
    "\n",
    "This could be explained by bundle purchases including downloadable content, or it might be a problem with the Steam software logging redundant entries. I made the decision to remove all of the duplicate purchase entries while keeping the multiple play entries, as these represent actual user engagement. This would remove 707 rows, and prepare the newly cleaned dataset for modelling.\n"

    "To explore the types of games being recommended by the model, we filtered the `prettyRecs` dataframe to show titles which contain the phrase ‘Football Manager’. There were 6 editions of this game found in the list of top average playtimes per game, given in the EDA section. Usually, when people engage with one edition of this game, they are more inclined to play the others, which makes the franchise a strong candidate for implicit engagement-based recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "By displaying these entries, we observed that these titles were often clustered within a single user’s top 10 recommendations. For example, `user_id` = 26813952 had six Football Manager games in their top 10 recommended games.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another block of code was added for extra analysis and observation. Here, we found the users that had at least one Football Manager game in their top 10, and then aggregated these counts to determine the distribution of recommendations. Users with one version of this title usually had 4 or 6 in their recommended top 10, confirming the hypothesis from before.\n",

    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we created a collaborative filtering recommender system using implicit feedback data from Steam. The system was built using ALS and trained on a real dataset containing 200,000 user-game interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data preprocessing steps were employed, such as deduplicating various rows of data and normalising play hours. Player behaviour was analysed and converted into a singular ‘rating’ value, and categorical features were converted into numeric indices for matrix factorisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then applied hyperparameter tuning and trained the model, before evaluating its performance with different types of metrics such as RMSE and Precision@10. This verified that the model was recommending games that align with user interests.\n",
    "\n",
    "One case study was that of the Football Manager franchise. The model effectively grouped titles of this series within the same user IDs, reflecting patterns that often take place within gaming culture. The same games would appear at the top of most lists recommended to users, such as ‘Counter Strike’, so there is still room for improvement. The model would benefit from explicit data and more hyperparameter tuning with `rank` and `maxIter`. Nevertheless, the recommender system performed to an acceptable level and there were obvious signs of success, while being a scalable approach.\n"
